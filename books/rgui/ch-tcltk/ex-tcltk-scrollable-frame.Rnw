This example\footnote{This example is modified from an example found
  at \url{
    http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/1999-June/005180.html}}
shows how to use a canvas widget to create a box container that
scrolls when more items are added than will fit in the display
area. The basic idea is that a frame is added to the canvas equipped
with scrollbars using the \subcommand{create window}{tkcanvas}
subcommand. 

There are two bindings to the \Event{Configure} event. The first
updates the scroll region of the canvas widget to include the entire
canvas, which grows as items are added to the frame. The second
binding ensures the child window is the appropriate width when the
canvas widget resizes. The height is not adjusted, as this is
controlled by the scrolling.

<<>>=
scrollableFrame <- function(parent, width =  300, height = 300) {
  canvasWidget <- 
    tkcanvas(parent,
             borderwidth = 0, highlightthickness = 0,
             width = width, height = height)
  addScrollbars(parent, canvasWidget)
  #
  gp <- ttkframe(canvasWidget, padding = c(0,0,0,0))
  gpID <- tkcreate(canvasWidget, "window", 0, 0, anchor = "nw", 
                   window = gp)
  tkitemconfigure(canvasWidget, gpID, width = width)
  ## update scroll region
  tkbind(gp,"<Configure>",function() {  
    bbox <- tcl(canvasWidget, "bbox", "all")
    tcl(canvasWidget,"config", scrollregion = bbox)
  })
  ## adjust "window" width when canvas is resized.
  tkbind(canvasWidget, "<Configure>", function(W) {
    width <- as.numeric(tkwinfo("width", W))
    gpwidth <- as.numeric(tkwinfo("width", gp))
    if(gpwidth < width)
      tkitemconfigure(canvasWidget, gpID, width = width)
  })
  return(gp)
}
@ 

To use this, we create a simple GUI as follows:
<<>>=
w <- tktoplevel()
tkwm.title(w,"Scrollable frame example")
g <- ttkframe(w); tkpack(g, expand = TRUE, fill = "both")
gp <- scrollableFrame(g, 300, 300)
@ 

To display a collection of available fonts requires a widget or
container that could possibly show hundreds of similar values. The
scrollable frame serves this purpose well
(cf. Figure~\ref{fig:fig-tcltk-all-fonts}).  The following shows how a
label can be added to the frame whose font is the same as the label
text. The available fonts are found from \function{tkfont.families}
and the useful coercion to character by \function{as.character}.
<<>>=
fFamilies <- as.character(tkfont.families())
## skip odd named ones
fFamilies <- fFamilies[grepl("^[[:alpha:]]", fFamilies)] 
for(i in seq_along(fFamilies)) {
  fName <- sprintf("::font::-%s", i)
  try(tkfont.create(fName, family = fFamilies[i], size = 14), 
      silent = TRUE)
  l <- ttklabel(gp, text = fFamilies[i], font = fName)
  tkpack(l, side = "top", anchor = "w")
}
