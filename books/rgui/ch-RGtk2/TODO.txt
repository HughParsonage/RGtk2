* running script from windows icon.

By the way I solved the event loop problem so the gui stops in batch mode and the users is able to interact with the gui.
It is done by just adding gtkMain() to the end of the script and building in a function gtkMainQuit() for the quit icon to stop the program when finished.
Regards,
