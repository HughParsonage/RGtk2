Put in description of 

R ---> toolkit; (handler) ---> R

It is handled differently in tcltk than Tcl/Tk
What about RGtk2?
in web programming, the picture is a bit different

browser ---> server, (R) ---> browser

The cycle is complete, no R --> browser with a request?


R ---> toolkit; (object) ---> R 
Does the object get coerced back? Not in tcltk, RGtk2 it does.
