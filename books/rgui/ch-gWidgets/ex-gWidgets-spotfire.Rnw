A common GUI application for data analysis consists of means to
visualize, query, aggregate and filter a data set. This example shows
how one can create such a GUI using \pkg{gWidgets} featuring an
embedded graphics device. In addition a visual display of the filtered
data, and a means to filter, or narrow, the data that is under
consideration, is presented (Figure~\ref{fig:gWidgets-spotfire-gui}).
Although, our example is not too feature rich, it illustrates a
framework that can easily be extended.

<<notShown, echo=FALSE>>=
library(gWidgets)
options(guiToolkit = "RGtk2")
@ 

This example is centered around filtering a data set, we choose a
convenient one:
<<ourData>>=
data("Cars93", package = "MASS")
@ 

We use a notebook to hold two tabs, one to give information and one
for the main GUI. This basic design comes from the spotfire demos at \url{tibco.com}.
<<layout>>=
window <- gwindow("Spotfire example", visible = FALSE)
notebook <- gnotebook(cont = window)
@ 


We use a simple label for information, although a more detailed
description would be warranted in an actual application.

<<page1>>=
descr <- glabel(gettext("A basic GUI to explore a data set"), 
                cont = notebook, label = gettext("About"))
@ 
%
Now we specify the layout for the second tab. This is a nested layout
made up of three box containers. The first, \code{group}, uses a
horizontal layout in which we pack in box containers that will use a
vertical layout.

<<page2>>=
group <- ggroup(cont = notebook, label = gettext("Explore..."))
left_group <- ggroup(cont = group, horizontal = FALSE) 
right_group <- ggroup(cont = group, horizontal = FALSE)
@ 

The left side will contain an embedded graphic device and a view of
the filtered data. The \constructor{ggraphics} widget provides the
graphic device.
<<results=hide>>=
ggraphics(cont = left_group)
@ 

Our tabular view of the data is provided by the \constructor{gtable} widget,
which facilitates the display of a data frame. The last two arguments
allow for multiple selection (for marking points on the graphic) and
for filtering through the \method{visible\ASSIGN}{gtable} method.
In addition to the table, we add a label to display the number of
cases being shown. This label is packed into a box container, and
forced to the right side through the \method{addSpring}{ggroup} method
of the box container.
<<>>=
tbl <- gtable(Cars93, cont = left_group, multiple = TRUE, 
              filter.FUN = "manual")
size(tbl) <- c(500, 200)                # set size
label_group <- ggroup(cont = left_group)
addSpring(label_group)
no_cases <- glabel("", cont = label_group)
@

The right panel is used to provide the user a means to filter the
display. We place the widgets used to do this within a frame to guide
the user.
<<filters>>=
filter_frame <- gframe(gettext("Filter by:"), 
                       cont = right_group, expand = TRUE)
@ 
The controls are layed out in a grid. We have two here to filter by:
type and the number of cylinders.
<<filterLayout>>=
lyt <- glayout(cont = filter_frame)
widget_list <- list() # store widgets
lyt[1,1] <- "Type:"
lyt[1,2] <- (widget_list$Type <- 
             gcombobox(c("", levels(Cars93$Type)), 
                       cont = lyt))

lyt[2,1] <- "Cylinders:"
lyt[2,2] <- (widget_list$Cylinders <- 
             gcombobox(c("", levels(Cars93$Cyl)), cont = lyt))
@ 
%
Of course, we could use many more criteria to filter by. The above
filters are naturally represented by a combo box. However, one could
have used many different styles, depending on the type of data. For
instance, one could employ a checkbox to filter through Boolean data,
a checkbox group to allow multiple selection, a slider to pick out
numeric data, or a text box to specify filtering by a string. The type
of data dictates this. In this example it isn't needed, but since the
layout is done, we might have code to initialize the controls in the
filter. Adding such a call, makes it easy to save the state of the GUI.

%% handlers
We now move on to the task of making the three main components -- the
display, the table and the filters -- interact with each other. We
keep this example simple, but note that if we were to extend the
example we would likely write using the observer pattern introduced in
Example~\ref{ex-gWidgets-ws-browser} as that makes it easy to decouple
the components of an interface. As it is we define function calls to
a) update the data frame when the filters change and b) update the
graphic.

For the first, we need to compute a logical variable indicating which
rows are to be displayed.  Within the definition of the following function, we
use the global variables \code{widget\_list}, \code{tbl} and \code{no\_cases}.
<<handlers>>=
update_data_frame <- function(...) {
  vals <- lapply(widget_list, svalue)
  vals <- vals[vals != ""] 
  out <- sapply(names(vals), function(i) {
    Cars93[[i]] == vals[[i]]
  })
  ind <- apply(out, 1, function(x) Reduce("&&", x))
  ## update table
  visible(tbl) <- ind
  ## update label
  nsprintf <- function(n, msg1, msg2,...)
    ngettext(n, sprintf(msg1, n), sprintf(msg2,n), ...)
  svalue(no_cases) <- nsprintf(sum(ind), "%s case", "%s cases")
}
@

% %% methods
% The \method{visible\ASSIGN}{gtable} and \method{svalue\ASSIGN}{glabel}
% methods change the underlying widgets. The generic
% \meth{svalue\ASSIGN} is used to change the primary value for a widget
% (and \meth{svalue} returns this value). In the above, we see these
% methods used to get the values from the combo boxes and to set the text
% in the label. The \meth{visible\ASSIGN} method is another generic. In
% this example it is used to specify which rows of the data are actually
% displayed by the widget.

This next function is used to update the graphic. A real application
would provide a more compelling plot.
<<>>=
update_graphic <- function(...) {
  ind <- visible(tbl)
  if(any(ind))
    plot(MPG.city ~ Weight, data = Cars93[ind,])
  else
    plot.new()
}
@ 

We now add a handler to be called whenever one of our combo boxes is
changed. This handler simply calls both our update functions.
<<applyHandler, results=hide>>=
callback <- function(h, ...) {
  update_data_frame()
  update_graphic()
}
sapply(widget_list, addHandlerChanged, handler = callback)
@ 
%
For the data display, we wish to allow the user to view individual cases
by clicking on a row of the table. The following will do so.

<<tableHandler>>=
addHandlerClicked(tbl, handler = function(h,...) {
  update_graphic()
  ind <- svalue(h$obj, index = TRUE)
  points(MPG.city ~ Weight, cex = 2, col = "red", pch = 16, 
         data = Cars93[ind,])
})
@ 
%
We could also use the \method{addHandlerChanged}{ggraphics} method to
add a handler to call when the user drags our a region in the graphics
device, but leave this for the interested reader.


Finally, we draw the GUI with an initial graphic
<<initialGraphic>>=
visible(window) <- TRUE
update_graphic()
@
