The following commands create some standard looking actions. The
handler \code{f} is just a stub to be replaced in a real application.
<<>>=
callback <- function(...) print("stub")        # a stub
open_action <- gaction("open", icon = "open", handler = callback)
quit_action <- gaction("quit", icon = "quit", handler = callback)
undo_action <- gaction("undo", icon = "undo", handler = callback)

A menubar and toolbar are specified through a list with named components, as is
illustrated next. The menubar list uses a nested list with
named components to specify a submenu.
<<>>=
toolbar_list <- list(open = open_action, quit = quit_action)
menubar_list <- list(File = list(
             open = open_action, 
             sep = gseparator(), 
             quit = quit_action),
           Edit = list(
             undo = undo_action
             ))

Menubars and toolbars are added to top-level windows, so their parent
containers are \code{gwindow} objects.
<<>>=
window <- gwindow("Example of menubars, toolbars")
menu_bar <- gmenu(menubar_list, cont = window)
tool_bar <- gtoolbar(toolbar_list, cont = window)
lable <- glabel("Test of DOM widgets", cont = window)

By disabling a \code{gaction} instance, we change the sensitivity of
all its realizations. Here this will only affect the menubar.

<<>>=
enabled(undo_action) <- FALSE

An ``undo'' menubar item, often changes its label when a new command
is performed, or the previous command is undone. The
\method{svalue\ASSIGN}{gaction} method can set the label text. This
shows how a new command can be added and how the menu item can be made
sensitive to mouse events.
<<>>=
svalue(undo_action) <- "undo: command"
enabled(undo_action) <- TRUE

Good GUI building principles suggest that one should not replace
values in the a menu, rather one should simply disable those that are
not being used. This allows the user to more easily become familiar
with the possible menu items. However, it may be useful to add to a
menu or toolbar. The \method{add}{gmenu} method can do so. For
example, to add a help menu item to our example one could do:
<<>>=
help_list <- list(Help = list(
                    help = gaction("manual", handler = callback)
                    ))
add(menu_bar, help_list)
