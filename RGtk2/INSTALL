This package can be installed as a regular R package.
In other words, the command 
   R CMD INSTALL RGtk
on Unix from any directory, or on Windows
   make pkg-RGtk
from within the src/gnuwin32/ directory within the
R distribution.

The binary version of this package for Windows can simply be unzipped
in a place that R can find it.

In all cases (i.e. Unix or Windows, source or binary), you will need
to have the appropriate Gtk libraries.

For Windows, you can download the Gtk and supporting libraries
from 
   http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/

For Unix, you can fetch the source files for the different
libraries from
   ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources
   ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources

The different Gnome libraries make extensive use of other libraries
and particular versions of these dependant libraries.  As a result,
installing Gnome can be a time consuming and apparently indirect
process that involves installing numerous sub-libraries.
