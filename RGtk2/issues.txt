Some current issues (bugs?) with RGtk2
----------

Specifics
---------

- these functions SHOULD free a string parameter by ref: (but they don't)
	pango_parse_markup, gtk_im_context_get_(preedit_string/surrounding), gtk_widget_(class)_path
- pango_reorder_items should not have its members setup for finalization

General
---------
- May need to figure out way to specify ownership in return by ref
----> Right now a few functions are implemented manually instead
- Need to set destroyed GtkObject variables to NULL
- Need to manage (sink-ref) widget memory

Tough Fixes (questionable worth)
-----------
- GTK property parsing - needs better GParamSpec support, manual GValue initialization
- Difficult to send non-GTyped data structures to callbacks
---> implement wrapper manually (without GClosure system)
- Cannot return a value by reference from a callback (see GtkRcPropertyParser, GdkPixbufSaveFunc)
---> implement manually, expect list of return values from R code
- Should the user be able to create GdkEvents from scratch?
- User functions without user-data are not wrappable
---> could implement custom list of callbacks, but this is a lot work

Problems with defs files (as provided by pygtk)
--------------------
- GtkFileInfo/GtkFileSystem etc are not public
- gtk_init_abi_* is not part of the public api
- gtk_ctree_base_nodes has been removed from gtk
- gtk_icon_view_new_with_model should be marked as constructor
- gdk_color_new, gdk_rectangle_new, gdk_pixbuf_new_from_array are not actual functions
- In my opinion, gdk_atom_name is a function not a method, GdkAtom is not an object
- Also, GdkRectangle is not an object and so should not have methods
- gdk_pixbuf_get_from_drawable/image - should be functions not methods
- GtkBindingSet, though in the API docs, is not documented, and seems internal
- gtk_drag_get_souce_widget is in gdk.defs, but I feel that it belongs in gtk.defs
- GtkPrivateFlags is not documented and sounds, well, private
- Lots of strange deprecated duplicates that we need to filter out
- Features added to pygtk (compliant to specs): in/out params, user functions, enum/flag values
- Hacked some type names, like G(S)List[type] to specify the component type and [] indicating array
- gdk_pixbuf_save_to_buffer is missing
