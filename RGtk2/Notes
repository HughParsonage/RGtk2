One the Mac (OS X 10.4), I added the directory 
   /usr/X11R6/lib/pkgconfig
to the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH to
get the configure script for gtk+-2.6.10 to
run to completion. Otherwise, I got an error
about Xft and the wrong version.

I don't think this is necessary as I think
I had not installed pango at the time. But
it is something  generally to be aware of.
The .pc files may be installed in a different place
than pkg-config looks for them.

The configure script needs to determine 
what is necessary, if it is available and
terminate if it is not.
Finding pkg-config and assuming libglade, firefox-mozembed,
etc. are installed  are very different things.

The bindings for the different 3rd party libraries
needs to be dealt with properly, as was done for
the Gtk-1.2 bindings. Either the configure script
needs to remove the files from the  target  .so
for the R package if the library is not installed,
or they need to be in separate packages. The latter
is more appropriate although it does require
potentially linking against a shared library  (i.e. libRGtk2.so)
for the different derived packages.

The RSPython fix is not a fix. It merely comments out an important
piece of code. Instead of this, the generator package needs to turn
off the user-defined converter for the list.  See the updated RSPython
for an R function that explicitly does this, or use the C routine.

A native port of Gtk+-2 for the Mac is underway and 
looking like it will succeed.

It is essential that the versions of the different elements that are used 
e.g. when building the bindings, when successfully installing the
package, etc. are documented.
Things don't install for me and of course I have no idea 
for what versions of the different libraries the bindings
were built.

It appears that the bindings are for 2.8.*
based on the presence of some enums that are not in
2.6.8.  We have to allow for people who don't
want to have to go through an entire upgrade of
the 4 packages, or perhaps more,

The INSTALL.html file refers to README.windows and INSTALL.windows
but they are not in the repository.
